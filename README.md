# IntelliStudy - AI Tools for Students

IntelliStudy is an AI-powered learning platform designed to enhance the educational experience for students of all levels. This project leverages advanced AI capabilities to provide practical tools that help with common academic tasks, making learning more efficient and accessible.

## Project Overview

IntelliStudy aims to democratize access to cutting-edge AI tools specifically tailored for educational purposes. In an increasingly digital learning environment, students often face challenges with information overload, time management, and effective study strategies. IntelliStudy addresses these challenges by providing a suite of specialized tools.

### Core Philosophy

The platform is built on three key principles:
- **Accessibility**: Making advanced AI tools available to all students regardless of technical background
- **Efficiency**: Helping students save time on routine tasks to focus on deeper understanding
- **Enhancement**: Augmenting learning capabilities rather than replacing traditional study methods

## Features

- **Text Summarization**: Transform lengthy academic papers, articles, and study materials into concise, digestible summaries while preserving key information and main arguments.

- **Content Rewriter**: Paraphrase texts to improve clarity, avoid plagiarism, and enhance your writing style. Perfect for refining essays, research papers, and notes.

- **AI Chatbot**: Engage with an intelligent assistant that can answer questions, explain concepts, provide examples, and help troubleshoot academic problems across various subjects.

- **Quiz Generator**: Create customized practice tests and quizzes on any topic to reinforce learning and prepare for exams. Set difficulty levels and receive immediate feedback.

## Technology Stack

IntelliStudy is built using modern web technologies:

- **Frontend**: Next.js, React, TailwindCSS
- **UI Components**: Shadcn UI
- **AI Integration**: Advanced language models via Dakaei API
- **Responsive Design**: Fully optimized for all devices from mobile to desktop
